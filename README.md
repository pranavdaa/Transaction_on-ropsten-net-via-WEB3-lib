# Transaction_on-ropsten-net-via-WEB3-lib
this is a boilerplate code for people who want to transaction on etherum via nodejs .
It has all the mian components in the app.js which are required to complete the transaction.
The main components required are-
1)CONNECT TO ROPSTEN NET VIA INFURA(A WEBSITE)
2)BUILD A TRANSACTION
3)SIGN THE TRANSACTION
4)BROADCAST THE TRANSACTION
I have done it on the ropsten test net You can do it even on the etherum main net.
The private Keys used in this are of no use and hence should be changed before using as per ur own metamask.
